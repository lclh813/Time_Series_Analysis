# Time Series Analysis
## Part 1. Objective
## Part 2. Data
## Part 3. Outline
### 3.1. Plot the time series data amd choose proper transfornations.
- A series with ***nonconstant variance*** often needs a ***variance-stabilizing transformation***
- Tool: ```Box-Cox’s Transformation```
- ***Box-Cox’s Transformation***

### 3.2. Further confirm a necessary degree of differencing.
- Compute and examine the sample ***ADF*** and the sample ***PACF*** of the transformed series to further confirm a necessary degree of differencing so that differenced series is ***stationary***.
- If the sample ***ACF*** decays very slowly and the sample ***PACF*** cuts off after ***lag 1***, then it indicates that differencing is needed.
- Tool: ```ACF``` ```PACF```

Compute and examine the sample ADF and the sample PACF of the transformed series.

## Part 4. Steps

Step 1. Plot the time series data and choose proper transformations.  
Step 2. Compute and examine the sample ACF and the sample of PACF of the original series.
