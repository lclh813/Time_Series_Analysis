### 3.2. General ***ARIMA(p,d,q)*** Model
- ***ARIMA*** stands for ***Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models*** and are, in theory, the most general models for forecasting a time series.
- ARIMA Model and its parameters are illustrated as follows:

<br>

- To identify a reasonably appropriate ARIMA model, ideally we need:      
  - ***Observations:*** A minimum of ***n=50*** observations.  
  - ***lag-k:*** The number of sample lag-k autocorrelations and autocorrelations to be calculated should be about ***n/4.*** 

### 3.3. Steps for Model Identification
### Step 1. Plot the Time Series Data and Choose Proper Transformations
- A series with non-constant variance often needs a ***variance-stabilizing transformations.***
- Tool: R ```library(forecast)``` ```BoxCox```
  - ***Box-Coxâ€™s Transformation:***

### Step 2. Identfy the Order of ***d***
### Step 2.1. Ordinary Differencing
- To further confirm a necessary degree of differencing so that differenced series is ***stationary.***
- Tool: R ```acf``` ```pacf```
  - ***ACF:*** 
    - Stands for ***Autocorrelation Function.***
    - It allows us to incorporate the effect of past values into our model.
  - ***PACF:*** 
    - Stands for ***Partial Autocorrelation Function.***
    - This allows us to set the error of our model as a linear combination of the error values observed at previous time points in the past.
  - If the sample ***ACF*** decays very ***slowly*** and the sample ***PACF*** cuts off after ***lag 1***, then it indicates that differencing is needed.
  
### Step 2.2. Seasonal Differencing
- To identify if there is a series of changes from one season to the next.
- Tool: R ```acf``` ```pacf```
  - If the sample ***ACF*** and the sample ***PACF*** suggest that there might be seasonal structure in the time series, then a seasonal differencing should be further applied.
  
### Step 3. Identfy the Orders of ***p*** and ***q***
### Option 3.1. Interpret ACF and PACF Plots
- If there still remains trend in the time series after transformations and differencing, an ***AR Model*** or an ***MA Model*** should be fitted.
- Tool: R ```acf``` ```pacf```
  - Characteristics of theoretical ACF and PACF for stationary process:

### Option 3.2. Compute ESACF
- For an ARMA(p,q) process, the ***vertex*** of the zero triangle in the asymptotic ESACF will be at ***(p,q)*** position.
- Tool: R ```library(TSA)``` ```eacf```

, which stands for ***Extended Sample Autocorrelation Function*** 

  
### Step 4. Determine the Coefficients of the Model
- If the coefficient estimate of the corresponding lag is ***less than twice of its standard error*** away from 0, it is implied that the autocorrelation at the given lag may not be significant and the elimination of the lag period should be considered.
- Tool: ```Standard Error```
