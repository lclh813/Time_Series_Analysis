## Part 1. Objective
## Part 2. Data
## Part 3. Outline
### 3.1. General ARIMA(p,d,q) Model
> To identify a reasonably appropriate ARIMA model, ideally we need:    
> ***Observations:***A minimum of ***n=50*** observations
> ***lag-k:*** The number of sample ***lag-k*** autocorrelations and autocorrelations to be calculated should be about ***n/4.***

### 3.2. Steps for Model Identification
### Step 1. Plot the Time Series Data and Choose Proper Transformations
- To ***stabilize*** a series with nonconstant variance.
- Tool: ```Box-Coxâ€™s Transformation```

### Step 2. Confirm a Necessary Degree of Differencing
### Step 2.1. Ordinary Differencing
- To make a non-stationary series ***stationary.***
- Tool: ```ACF``` ```PACF```
  - If the sample ***ACF*** decays very ***slowly*** and the sample ***PACF*** cuts off after ***lag 1***, then it indicates that differencing  is needed.
  
### Step 2.2. Seasonal Differencing
- To identify if there is a series of changes from one season to the next.
- Tool: ```ACF``` ```PACF```
  - If the sample ***ACF*** and the sample ***PACF*** suggest that there might be seasonal structure in the time series, then a seasonal differencing should be further applied.
  
### Step 3. Identfy the Orders of ***p*** and ***q***
- 
  
### 3.5. Determine the Coefficient of the Model

## Part 4. Steps

Step 1. Plot the time series data and choose proper transformations.  
Step 2. Compute and examine the sample ACF and the sample of PACF of the original series.
